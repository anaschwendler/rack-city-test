# rack-city-test

I'm just learning how to use Rack: https://github.com/rack/rack

Rack is the most basic way to build a very simple web application in Ruby.

Based on: http://webapps-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/rack.html

To run:

```
rackup
```

This command looks for a file `config.ru` in the current directory, and starts a web server using it, on your local computer.

Then go to: http://localhost:9292
